For Assignment-3:

I am confused with GenericDAO methods search() and getById(), we have to call it from direct ExamDataService class by creating an object of GenericDAO with UserDAO, QuestionDAO and AnswerDAO??

OR

We need to create methods in UserDAO, QuestionDAO and AnswerDAO classes to access search() and getById() of GenericDAO??
